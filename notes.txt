Assembly-fundamental unit of deployement/pre compiled chunk of code run by CLR
DLL is used in web applications run by web servers(iiiit is also an executable file)
Assembly Contains: Manifest and IL code


Private and shared assemblies
PRIVATE ASSEMBLY:
It is used by single application and usually it is stored in that application's install directory
Eg.   debug>bin


ILDasm-Intermediate language Disassembler: Used to extract the contents of dll file
goto vs cmd run as admin: ildasm.exe with complete path


ILAsm-Intermediate language Assembler: Used to reconstruct an assembly from a text file that contains manifest and IL

Weak Named Assembly and Strong Named Assembly:
Assembly consists of 
1.A textual name
2.Assembly Version Number
3.Assembly Culture information(Language)
4.Public key token


.......................Private Assembly(Do NOT Have public key token)-->Public Assembly(Have Public key Token)
**Weak Name assembly ko strong name assembly banana padega.
If the assembly is not signed with the public key pair the assembly is weak named and not guarnteed to be unique and may cause DLL Hell.
Strong named assembly



................................................CREATION OF PUBLIC KEY TOKEN................................................................

1.Goto VS commond prompt and run as administrator

2.Write  sn -k <Write loactaion where you want to create public key token and public key token name like> c:\Mykey.snk
         sn -k stands for strong name key

3.Now press enter

................................................Creating Private Assembly as Shared Assembly................................

1. Check for strong name key in folder

2. Now goto project and open AssemblyInfo.cs file in project and add attribute(TO BE DONE ONCE)
 					[assembly:AssemblyKeyFile("<complete path address with name and extension snk>")] 

3.Now build the project

4.Assembly is now signed with private and public key pair

5.To install an assembly using GAC utility
			Gacutil -i <pathname>   like "c:\assemblypath"

6.To uninstall assembly using GAC utility
			Gacutil -u <assembly name>
